## Getting Started

Are you ready to embark on this headless e-commerce adventure? Let's get you started on the path to e-commerce greatness with QShop. Follow these simple steps:

1. **Sign Up and Register Your Store**: Head over to [app.qshop.tech](https://app.qshop.tech) for your production store or [staging.qshop.tech](https://staging.qshop.tech) for your staging environment. Create an account, and then register your brand-new store.

2. **Retrieve Your Store API Key**: After registration, generate and retrieve your store API key. This key is your secret weapon for updating settings via the API. For detailed instructions, refer to the [Admin Portal API](/api-reference) in our documentation.

3. **Find Your Store Slug**: Your store's unique slug can be found in the URL or on your domain page. Make note of it, as you'll need it for the next step.

4. **Fetch Shop Slug**: Use your store's slug to run a query to the [Fetch Shop Slug](/storefront-reference/shops/fetch-shop-by-slug) endpoint. This will help you retrieve the store ID, which you'll reuse in subsequent requests that require the shopId path parameter.
